Summary:
In conclusion, client deliverables were delivered on schedule. One major drawback of this new design is that it requires the user to be familiar with the data such as the specific cities, shapes, state, dates in order to efficiently utilize the filter. 

An additinal reccomendation to improve the filters is to add the functionality which allows users to filter the date by range and not just a specific date.
